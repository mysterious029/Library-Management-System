## Library Management System

### Description

The Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to streamline the operations of a library, facilitating efficient management of books, users, and transactions. The system incorporates Object-Oriented Design principles to ensure clear relationships and responsibilities among its components. It utilizes file-based storage for reliable data persistence and implements a Command Line Interface (CLI) for user interaction. The application emphasizes error handling, input validation, modularity, and scalability for easy extension and modification.

### Key Functionalities:
